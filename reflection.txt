# Reflection:
# 1. When is a for loop better than a while loop?
# A for loop is better when you know exactly how many times
# the loop should run, such as counting or iterating over a range.

# 2. What's one bug you ran into and how did you fix it?
# A common bug was forgetting to update the variable inside
# the while loop, which caused an infinite loop.
# I fixed it by making sure the user's guess was updated
# every iteration.
